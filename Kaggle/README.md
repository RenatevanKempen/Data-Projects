Kaggle is a great site for getting datasets and do projects if you want to practise your skills as a DataScientist. 

Remember to:
- Always make clear what you are doing and for what purpose.
- Add comments to each line that needs explaining.
- Hide the commandlines you do not find really interesting. This way people can still see them, but it will make your notebook much more readible.

If you need inspiration, I like to look at how the top 3 (in other contests) are building up their notebook. 

Have fun with all the Kaggle projects. 
Should you have any tips or questions, let me know via an [email](renate@baime.nl).

Have a great day and happy coding!

Renate
